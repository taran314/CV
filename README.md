# Personal Summary

I am an energetic and ambitious Makers Academy graduate, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge.

After graduating from the University of Birmingham with a degree in mathematics, I became a teacher to share my passion for mathematics and helping others.
As a Mathematician, my hunger for solving problems was not satisfied, so I learned how to programme as a creative outlet to solve problems.
To further my development, I completed a university introductory computer science course indepedently online as I am passionate about learning more and furthering my coding skills.
My coding journey started with many late nights on codewars to building full stack web applications at Makers Academy in under five months.

I am eagar to apply driven nature, analytical mindset and rapidily developing programming skills to create technology that solves real world problems and makes a difference to people's lives.

# Skills
<!-- Add leetcode and data structures - building on CS knowledge  -->
#### Fast adaptable learner

When I became a teacher there was a high learning curve initially as I taught several classes from Year 7 to 12 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the unprecedented circumstances, I quickly adapted to my role by reflecting on what I could improve and asking my colleagues for support.
During my third week as a teacher I went above and beyond by ensuring I delivered high quality lessons to my students when teach remotely.
Despite not having experience teaching remotely, I adapted my teaching style by making use of geometric software and improved the quality of my lessons by reflecting incrementally. 
Furthermore, I have demonstrated that I am a fast learner during my time at Makers Academy by developing a native application using the MERN tech stack in my [final project](https://github.com/taran314/controLLyfe) in seven days.

#### Confident communicator

As a teacher, having strong communication was important in explaining complex mathematics to my students.
I have furthered my communication skills during the Makers bootcamp across the group projects by leading stand ups, retrospectives and group planning sessions.
Furthermore, I presented my final project to my bootcamp peers, where I explained how our app worked and answered technical questions confidentenly, and to a non-technical audience.

#### Logical problem solver

I have naturally developed problem solving skills from studying maths up to degree level which I have utilised when coding. 
Particularly I enjoy writing algorithms in my spare time indepdendently which required a lot of perseverance, but has improved my debugging and testing skills (examples [Python](https://github.com/taran314/Python_Challenges) and [Ruby](https://github.com/taran314/Ruby-Projects)).
During my time at Makers I have taken several external reviews and have used feedback to improve my ability to TDD and refactor code.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (February to May 2021)

* Built web apps in **Ruby** and **Javascript** by learning independently and collobratively in group projects.
* Worked in **Agile** teams using **pair programming**, **Git workflow** and **XP values**.
* Learned and applied software design principles such as **OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD**.
* Created a fitness app allowing users to customise and track their workouts. Used **MongoDB**, **Node** and **Express** to build a **RESTful API** which serves a **React Native** front-end. Unit tested with **Jest** and deployed to the app store with **Expo**.
* Developed a social media app by building a **Rails API**, hosted on **Heroku**, with a **PostgreSQL** database and a **React Native front** frontend. API manages CRUD operations for several resources and we achieved high test coverage on the backend using **RSpec**. 
  
#### UC Berkeley - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-study)

* Introductory Computer Science course in **Python**.
* Main Ideas: Abstraction, Object oriented and functional programming.
* Key concepts: Recursion, higher order functions, tree recursion, list comprehension and generators.  

#### University of Birmingham (September 2019 to July 2020)

* Postgraduate Diploma in Education, Mathematics - Pass (final review graded as Outstanding)

#### University of Birmingham (September 2015 to July 2018)

* BSc Mathematics - First-class with Honours
  
#### Solihull Sixth form (September 2012 to July 2014)
* A level Mathematics - A*
* A level Chemistry - A
* A level Further Mathematics - B

## Experience

**Kings Norton Girls School** (September 2020 to January 2021)
*Teacher of Mathematics*

- Taught secondary and sixth form level mathematics at a top comprehensive in Birmingham.
- Confidently delivered high quality lessons, which involved engaging students and managing classroom behaviour throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Took initiative by going above and beyond in delivering high quality lessons whilst self-isolating over zoom by incorporating - dynamic mathematics software in my teaching.
- Managed a high workload of planning lessons, marking assignments and giving students feedback efficiently.
- Communicated with parents throughout the term and at parents evenings on their child's progress.

**Private tutor** (September 2018 - Present)

- Tutored from primary to degree level in Mathematics and secondary Chemistry and Physics.
