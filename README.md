# Motivation
  
I am a strategic and logical thinker who is passionate about solving problems. 
I gained my passion for solving problems whilst studying at the University of Birmingham, where I achieved a first-class degree in Mathematics. After I graduated I decided to become a Mathematics teacher, as I am passionate about helping others, but found that my desire to solve problems was not fulfilled. Coding has become a passion of mine as it provides me with an outlet to solve problems and taps into my analytical mindset.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (February to May 2021)

* Built web apps in **Ruby** and **Javascript** by learning independently and in collobratively in group projects.
* In group projects we worked in **Agile** teams using **pair programming**, **Git workflow** and **XP values**.
* Learned and applied software design principles such as **OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD**.
* Created a fitness app allowing users to customise and track their workouts. Used **MongoDB**, **Node** and **Express** to build a **RESTful API** which serves a **React Native** front-end. Unit tested with **Jest** and deployed to the app store with **Expo**.
* Developed a social media app by building a **Rails API**, hosted on **Heroku**, with a **PostgreSQL** database and a **React Native front** frontend. The API manages CRUD operations for several resources and we achieved high testing on the backend using **RSpec**. 
  
#### UC Berkley - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-study)

* Introductory Computer Science course in **Python**.
* Main Ideas: Abstraction, Object oriented and functional programming.
* Key concepts: Recursion, higher order functions, tree recusion, list comprehension and generators.  

#### University of Birmingham (September 2019 to July 2020)

* Postgraduate Diploma in Education, Mathematics - Pass (final review graded as Outstanding)

#### University of Birmingham (September 2015 to July 2018)

* BSc Mathematics - First-class with Honours
  
#### Solihull Sixth form (September 2012 to July 2014)
* A level Mathematics - A*
* A level Chemistry - A
* A level Further Mathematics - B

## Experience

**Kings Norton Girls School** (September 2020 to January 2021)
*Teacher of Mathematics*

- Taught secondary and sixth form level mathematics at a top comprehensive in Birmingham.
- Confidently delivered high quality lessons, which involved engaging students and managing classroom behaviour throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Took initiative by going above and beyond in delivering high quality lessons whilst self-isolating over zoom by incorporating - dynamic mathematics software in my teaching.
- Managed a high workload of planning lessons, marking assignments and giving students feedback efficiently.
- Liaison with parents throughout the term and at parents evenings.

**Private tutor** (September 2018 - Present)

- Tutored from primary to degree level in Mathematics and secondary Chemistry and Physics.
- Supported students in their UCAS application.
- Built a rapport with students from diverse backgrounds and engaged them in their learning
- Liaising with parents to determine students’ needs.
- Adapted my teaching to deliver sessions online.

**Explore Learning**  (June 2016 – October 2017)  
*Tutor*

- Tutored children aged 4 – 14 in Mathematics and English.
- Once I became experienced, I ran the front of the tuition centre, which involved greeting parents and leading a team of tutors to deliver services efficiently.
- Liaison with colleagues and proactively supported new tutors ensuring they felt welcome.
- Built a rapport with parents, ensuring they were satisfied with their child’s learning and pitched to prospective parents, booking many for trial sessions.
